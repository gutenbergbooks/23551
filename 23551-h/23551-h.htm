      WHO CROSSES STORM MOUNTAIN?
    </h1>

    <p>
      The wind stirred in the weighted pines; the snow lay on the ground. Here
      and there on its smooth, white expanse footprints betokened the woodland
      gentry abroad. In the pallid glister of the moon, even amid the sparse,
      bluish shadows of the leafless trees, one might discriminate the
      impression of the pronged claw of the wild turkey, the short, swift paces
      of the mink, the padded, doglike paw of the wolf. A progress of a yet more
      ravening suggestion was intimated in great hoof-marks leading to the door
      of a little log cabin all a-crouch in the grim grip of winter and
      loneliness and poverty on the slope of the mountain, among heavy,
      outcropping ledges of rock and beetling, overhanging crags. With icy
      ranges all around as far as the eye could reach, with the vast, instarred,
      dark sky above, it might seem as if sorrow, the world, the law could
      hardly take account of so slight a thing, so remote. But smoke was slowly
      stealing up from its stick-and-clay chimney, and its clapboarded roof
      sheltered a group with scarcely the heart to mend the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two women shivered on the broad hearth before the dispirited embers. One
      had wept so profusely that she had much ado to find a dry spot in her
      blue-checked apron, thrown over her head, wherewith to mop her tears. The
      other, much younger, her fair face reddened, her blue eyes swollen, her
      auburn curling hair all tangled on her shoulders, her voice half-choked
      with sobs, addressed herself to the narration of their woes, her cold,
      listless hands clasped about her knees as she sat on an inverted
      bushel-basket, for there was not a whole chair in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then he jes' tuk an' leveled!&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young hunter standing on the threshold, leaning on his rifle, a brace of
      wild turkeys hanging over his shoulders, half a dozen rabbits dangling
      from his belt, stared at her through the dull, red glow of the fading fire
      in amazed agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he level, Medory&mdash;a gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wuss'n that!&rdquo; replied the younger woman. &ldquo;He leveled the weepon o' the
      law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man turned to look again at the curious disarray of the room. &ldquo;The law
      don't allow him to do sech ez this!&rdquo; he blurted out in rising anger. &ldquo;Why,
      everything hyar is bodaciously broke an' busted! War it the sheriff
      himself ez levied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twar jes' the dep'ty critter, Clem Tweed,&rdquo; explained Medora, &ldquo;mighty
      joki-fied, an' he 'peared ter be middlin' drunk, an' though he said
      su'thin' 'bout exemptions he 'lowed ez we-uns lived at the eend o' the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother-in-law suddenly lowered the apron from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The jumpin'-off place,' war what Clem Tweed called it!&rdquo; she interpolated
      with a fiery eye of indignant reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did! He did!&rdquo; Medora bitterly resented this fling at the remoteness of
      their poor home. &ldquo;An' he said whilst hyar he'd level on everything in
      sight, ez he hoped never ter travel sech roads agin&mdash;everything in
      sight, even the baby an' the cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, Medory, ye know the dep'ty man war funnin' whenst he said that
      about the baby an' the cat! Ye know ez Clem admitted he hed Christmas in
      his bones!&rdquo; the elder objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, war Clem Tweed funnin' whenst he done sech ez that, in levyin' an
      execution?&rdquo; Bruce Gilhooley pointed with his ramrod at the wreck of the
      furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women burst into lugubrious sobs and rocked themselves back and
      forth in unison. &ldquo;'Twar <i>Dad!</i>&rdquo; Medora moaned, in smothered accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause of bewilderment ensued. Then the young man's face took on an
      expression of dismay so ominous that Medora's tears were checked in the
      ghastly fear of disasters yet to come to her father-in-law. Now and again
      she glanced anxiously over her shoulder at an oblong black aperture in the
      dusk which betokened the open door of the shed-room. Some one lurked
      there, evidently cherishing all aloof a grief, an anger, a despair too
      poignant to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad warn't hyar whenst the dep'ty leveled,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;An' mighty glad we
      war&mdash;kase somebody mought hev got hurt. But whenst Dad kem home an'
      larnt the news he jes'&mdash;he jes'&mdash;he jes' lept about like a
      painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did! He did!&rdquo; asseverated a voice from the veiled head, all muffled in
      the checked apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad 'lowed,&rdquo; continued Medora, &ldquo;ez Peter Petrie hev persecuted and druv
      him ter the wall. Fust he tricked Dad out 'n some unoccupied lan' what Dad
      hed begun ter clear, an' Petrie got it entered fust an' tuk out a grant
      an' holds the title! An' whenst Dad lay claim ter it Peter Petrie declared
      ef enny Gilhooley dared ter cross Storm Mounting he'd break every bone in
      his body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true word&mdash;the insurance of the critter!&rdquo; came from the
      blue-checked veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stir in the shed-room&mdash;-a half-suppressed cough and a clearing of
      the throat. &ldquo;An' then Dad fell on Pete Petrie at the Crossroads' store,
      whar the critter hed stopped with his mail-pouch, an' Dad trounced him
      well afore all the crowd o' loafers thar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless the Lord, he did!&rdquo; the checked apron voiced a melancholy triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then, ye remember whenst Dad set out fire in the woods las' fall ter
      burn off the trash on his own lan', the flames run jes' a leetle over his
      line an' on ter them woods on Storm Mounting, doin' no harm ter nobody,
      nor nuthin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mite&mdash;not a mite,&rdquo; asseverated the apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ez sech appears ter be agin the law Petrie gin information an' Dad
      war fined five dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' paid it!&rdquo; cried Jane Gilhooley. &ldquo;Ye know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then, ez it 'pears ter be the law ez one hundred dollars fur sech an
      offense is ter be forfeited ter ennybody ez will sue fur it,&rdquo; Medora
      resumed, &ldquo;Petrie seen his chance ter git even fur bein' beat in a reg'lar
      knock-down-an'-drag-out fight, an',&rdquo; with the rising inflection of a
      climax, &ldquo;he hev sued and got jedgmint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' so what that half-drunk dep'ty, Clem Tweed, calls an execution war
      leveled!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane Gilhooley, her veiled head swaying forlornly as
      she sobbed invisibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dad 'lowed ez Peter Petrie shouldn't hev none o' his gear,&rdquo; Medora's
      eyes flashed with a responsive sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His gran'mam's warpin' bars!&rdquo; suggested the elder woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spinnin'-wheels she brung from No'th Carliny,&rdquo; enumerated Medora,
      &ldquo;the loom an' the candle-moulds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cheers his dad made fur his mam whenst they begun housekeeping&rdquo; said
      Jane Gilhooley's muffled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The press an' the safe,&rdquo; Medora continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pot an' the oven,&rdquo; chokingly responded the apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The churn an' the piggins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skillet an' the trivet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Medora, fairly flinching from the inventory of all the household goods, so
      desecrated and &ldquo;leveled on,&rdquo; returned to the salient incident of the day.
      &ldquo;Dad jes' tuk an axe an' bust up every yearthly thing in the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now we-uns ain't got nuthin'.&rdquo; The elder woman looked about in
      stunned dismay, her little black eyes a mere gleam of a pupil in the midst
      of their swollen lids and network of wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the miseries of the very ignorant is, paradoxically, the partial
      character of their privations. If the unknown were to them practically
      non-existent they might find solace in sluggish and secure content. But
      even the smallest circle of being touches continually the periphery of
      wider spheres. The air is freighted with echoes of undistinguished sounds.
      Powers, illimitable, absolute, uncomprehended, seem to hold an inimical
      sway over their lives and of these the most dreaded is the benign law,
      framed for their protection, spreading above them an unperceived,
      unimagined aegis. Thus there was hardly an article in the house which was
      not exempt by statute from execution, and the house itself and land worth
      only a hundred or two dollars were protected by the homestead law. The
      facetious deputy, Clem Tweed, with &ldquo;Christmas in his bones,&rdquo; would have
      committed a misdemeanor in seriously levying upon them. He had held the
      affair as a capital farce&mdash;even affecting with wild, appropriating
      gambols to seize the baby and the cat&mdash;and fully realized that malice
      only had prompted the whole proceeding, to humiliate Ross Gilhooley and
      illustrate the completeness of the victory which Peter Petrie had won over
      his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger Gilhooley, however, quaked as his limited intelligence laid
      hold on the fact that if the law had permitted a levy on the household
      goods to satisfy the judgment of Peter Petrie their destruction was in
      itself a balking of the process, resistance to the law, and with an
      unimagined penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-uns hev got ter git away from hyar somehows!&rdquo; he said with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of bluff Ross Gilhooley in the clutches of the law because of one
      fierce moment of goaded and petulant despair, with the ignominy of a
      criminal accusation, with all the sordid concomitants of arrest and the
      jail, was infinitely terrible to his unaccustomed imagination. He revolted
      from its contemplation with a personal application. For an honest man,
      however poor, feels all the high prerogatives of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a step in the shed-room where Ross Gilhooley had lurked and
      listened. His wrath now spent, his mind had traveled the obvious course to
      his son's conclusion. He stood a gigantic, bearded shadow in the doorway,
      half ashamed, wholly repentant, dimly, vaguely fearful, and all responsive
      and quivering to the idea of flight. &ldquo;I been studyin' some 'bout goin' ter
      Minervy Sue's in Georgy,&rdquo; he said creakingly, as if his voice had suffered
      from its unwonted disuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' none too soon,&rdquo; said Bruce doggedly. &ldquo;The oxen is Medory's, bein'
      lef' ter her whenst her dad died, an' the wagin is mine! Quit foolin'
      along o' that thar fire, Medory!&rdquo; For with her bright hair hanging curling
      over her cheeks his young wife had leaned forward to start it anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never ter kindle it agin on this ha'th-stone!&rdquo; she cried with a poignant
      realization of the significance of the uprooting of the roof-tree and the
      wide, vague world without. And still once more the two women fell to
      bemoaning their fate of exile beside the expiring embers, while the elder
      Gilhooley's voice sounded bluffly outside calling the oxen, and his son
      was rattling their heavy yoke in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were well advanced on their journey ere yet the snowy Christmas dawn
      was in the sky. So slow a progress was ill-associated with the idea of
      flight. It was almost noiseless&mdash;the great hoofs of the oxen fell all
      muffled on the deep snow still whitely a-glitter with the moon, hanging
      dense and opaque in the western sky, and flecked with the dendroidal
      images of the overshadowing trees. The immense bovine heads swayed to and
      fro, cadenced to the deliberate pace, and more than once a muttered low of
      distaste and protest rose with the vapor curling upward from lip and
      nostril into the icy air. On the front seat of the cumbrous, white,
      canvas-covered vehicle was Medora, her bright hair blowing out from the
      folds of a red shawl worn hood-wise; she held a cord attached to the horns
      of one of the oxen by which she sought to guide the yoke in those
      intervals when her husband, who walked by their side with a goad, must
      needs fall to the rear to drive up a cow and calf. Inside the wagon Ross
      Gilhooley did naught but bow his head between his hands as if he could not
      face the coming day charged with he knew not what destiny for him. His
      wife was adjusting and readjusting the limited gear they had dared to
      bring off with them&mdash;their forlorn rags of clothing and bedding, all
      in shapeless bundles; sundry gourds full of soft soap, salt, tobacco, and
      a scanty store of provisions, which she feared would not last them all the
      way to Georgia to the home of Minervy Sue, their daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one touched a space deeply filled with straw, but now and again Medora
      glanced back at it with the dawning of a smile in her grief-stricken face
      that cold, nor fear, nor despair could wholly overcast. Three small heads,
      all golden and curly, all pink-cheeked and fair, all blissfully
      slumbering, rested there as if they had been so many dolls packed away
      thus for fear of breaking. But they had no other couch than the straw, for
      Ross Gilhooley had not spared the feather-beds, and the little cabin at
      the Notch was now half full of the fluff ripped out by his sharp knife
      from the split ticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the mountain the fugitives went, as silent as their shadows; and at
      last, when one might hardly know if it were the sheen of the moon that
      still illuminated the wan and wintry scene, or the reflection from the
      snow, or the dawning of the dark-gray day, the river came in sight, all a
      rippling, steely expanse under the chill wind between its ice-girt crags
      and snowy banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oxen went down to the ford in a lumbering run. Bruce sprang upon the
      tailboard to ride, the dogs chased the cow and calf to the crossing. The
      wheels grated ominously against great submerged boulders; the surging
      waves rose almost to the wagon-bed; the wind struck aslant the immense,
      cumbrous cover, threatening to capsize it; and, suddenly, in the midst of
      the transit, a sound, as clear as a bugle in the rare icy air, as
      searchingly sweet!
    </p>
    <p>
      All were motionless for an instant, doubtful, anxious, listening&mdash;only
      the wintry wind with its keen sibilance; only the dash of the swift
      current; only the grating of the wheels on the sand as the oxen reached
      the opposite margin!
    </p>
    <p>
      But hark, again! A clear tenor voice in the fag end of an old song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;An' my bigges' bottle war my bes' friend,
     An' my week's work was all at an end!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It issued from beyond the right fork of the road in advance, and an
      instant panic ensued. Discovery was hard upon them. Their laborious device
      was brought to naught should any eye espy them in their hasty flight to
      the State line. It had not seemed impossible that ere the day should dawn
      they might be far away in those impenetrable forests where one may journey
      many a league, meeting naught more inimical or speculative than bear or
      deer. It still was worth the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden spring from the tailboard of the wagon Bruce Gilhooley
      reached the yoke, fiercely goading the oxen onward. With an abrupt lurch,
      in which the vehicle swayed precariously and ponderously from side to
      side, they started up the steep, snowy bank, and breaking into their
      ungainly rim were guided into the left fork of the road. It was a level
      stretch and fringed about with pines, and soon all sight of the pilgrims
      was lost amidst the heavy snow-laden boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river bank was silent and solitary; and after a considerable interval
      a man rode down from the right fork to the ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once his horse refused the passage. A sort of parrot-faced man
      he was, known as Tank Dysart, young, red-haired, with a long, bent nose
      and a preposterous air of knowingness and turbulent inquiry. He cocked his
      head on one side with a snort of surprised indignation, and beat with both
      heels, but again the horse, sidling about the drifts, declined the direct
      passage and essayed to cross elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a bundle of red flannel, lying in the drift close to the
      water's edge, caught his attention, and suddenly there issued forth a
      lusty bawl. The horseman would have turned pale but for the whisky which
      had permanently incarnadined the bend of his nose. As it was, however, he
      looked far more dismayed than the facts might seem to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the booze&mdash;I got 'em again fur sartain!&rdquo; he quavered in
      plaintive helplessness, his terrified eyes fixed on the squirming bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, drunk as he was, he perceived the rift in his logic &ldquo;Gol-darn ye!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, violently kicking the horse, &ldquo;you-uns ain't got no call ter
      view visions an' see sights&mdash;ye old water-bibber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the horse continued to snort and back away from the object Tank Dysart
      became convinced of its reality. Still mounted, he passed close enough
      alongside for a grasp at it. The old red-flannel cape and hood disclosed a
      plump infant about ten months of age, whimpering and cruelly rubbing his
      eyes with his fists, and now bawling outright with rage; as he chanced to
      meet the gaze of his rescuer he paused to laugh in a one-sided way,
      displaying two pearly teeth and a very beguiling red tongue, but again
      stiffening himself he yelled as behooves a self-respecting baby so
      obviously misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tank Dysart held him out at arm's length in his strong grasp, surveying
      him in mingled astonishment and delight. &ldquo;Why, bless my soul, Christmas
      gift!&rdquo; he addressed him. &ldquo;I'm powerful obligated fur yer company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the genial infant giggled and sputtered and gurgled inconsistently in
      the midst of his bawling, and banteringly kicked out one soft foot in a
      snug, red sock, faking Tank full in the chest; then he stiffened, swayed
      backward and screamed again as if in agonies of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufferin' Moses!&rdquo; grinned the drunkard. &ldquo;I wouldn't take nuthin' fur ye!
      Ye air a find, an' no mistake!&rdquo; The word suggested illusion. &ldquo;Ye ain't no
      snake, now&mdash;nary toad&mdash;nary green rabbit&mdash;no sort'n
      jim-jam?&rdquo; he stipulated apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby babbled gleefully, and, as if attesting its reality, delivered
      half a dozen strong kicks with those active plump feet, encased in the
      smart red socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly occurred to the drunkard that here was a duty owing&mdash;to
      seek out the child's parents. Even to his befuddled brain that fact was
      plain enough. The little creature had been lost evidently from some family
      of travelers who would presently retrace their way seeking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bruce Gilhooley had sprung from the tailboard of the wagon in that
      moment of tumultuous panic he had not noticed the bundle of straw
      dislodged. Falling with it softly into the deep snowdrift the child had
      continued to slumber quietly till awakened by the cold to silence and
      loneliness, and then this strange rencontre.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a half-discriminated idea of overtaking the supposed travelers, Tank
      Dysart briskly forded the river, and, pressing his horse to a canter, made
      off in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gayly they fared along for a time, Tank frequently refreshing himself from
      a &ldquo;tickler,&rdquo; facetiously so-called, which he carried in his pocket.
      Occasionally he generously offered the baby the stopper to suck, and as
      the child smacked his lips with evident relish Tank roared out again in
      his fine and flexible tenor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my bigges' bottle war my bes' friend, an' my week's work war all at
      an end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse, by far the nobler animal of the two, stood still ever and anon
      when the drunken creature swayed back and forth in his saddle, imperiling
      his equilibrium. Even to his besotted mind, as he grew more intoxicated,
      the danger to the child in his erratic grasp became apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got ter put him in a safe place&mdash;a Christmas gift,&rdquo; he now and
      then stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came at last within reach of a human habitation he had been for
      some time consciously on the point of falling from the saddle with the
      infant, who was now quietly asleep. He noted, as in a dream, the
      Crossroads' store, which was also the post-office; standing in front of
      the log cabin was a horse already saddled hanging down a dull, dispirited
      head as he awaited the mail-rider through a long, cold interval, and
      bearing a United States mail-pouch, mouldy, flabby, nearly empty. The door
      of the store was closed against the cold; the blacksmith's shop was far
      down the road; the two or three scattered dwellings showed no sign of life
      but the wreaths of blue smoke curling up from the clay-and-stick chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the impunity of the moment that suggested the idea to
      Dysart's whimsical drunken fancy. He never knew. He suddenly tried the
      mouth of the pouch. It was locked. Nothing daunted, a stroke of a keen
      knife slit the upper part of the side seam, the sleeping baby was slipped
      into the aperture, and Tank Dysart rode off chuckling with glee to think
      of the dismay of the mail-rider when the mall-pouch should break forth
      with squeals and quiver with kicks, which embarrassment would probably not
      befall him until far away in the wilderness with his perplexity, for there
      had been something stronger on that stopper than milk or cambric tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Tank went he muttered something about the security of the United States
      mail, wherein he had had the forethought to deposit his Christmas gift,
      and forthwith he flung himself into the shuck-pen, where he fell asleep,
      and was not found till half-frozen, his whereabouts being at last
      disclosed to the storekeeper by the persistent presence of his faithful
      steed standing hard by. Tank was humanely cared for by this functionary,
      but several days elapsed before he altogether recovered consciousness; it
      was naturally a confused, disconnected train of impressions which his mind
      retained. At first, in a maudlin state, he demanded of the storekeeper, in
      his capacity as postmaster also, a package, a Christmas gift, which he
      averred he should receive by mail. Albeit this was esteemed merely an
      inebriated fancy, such is the sensitiveness of the United States postal
      service on the subject of missing mail matter that the postmaster,
      half-irritated, half-nervous, detailed it to the mail-rider. &ldquo;Tank 'lows
      ez he put it into the mail hyar himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Petrie, a lowering-eyed, severe-visaged, square-jawed man, gave Tank
      Dysart only a glance of ire from under his hat-brim, as if the matter were
      not worth the waste of a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dysart, wreck though he was, had not yet lost all conscience. He was in an
      agony of remorse and doubt. It kept him sober longer than he had been for
      five years, for he was a professed drunkard and idler, scarcely considered
      responsible. He could not be sure that he had experienced aught which he
      seemed to remember&mdash;he hoped it was all only his drunken fancy, for
      what could have been the fate of the child subject to the freaks of his
      imbecile folly! He was reassured to hear no rumors of a lost child, and
      yet so definite were the images of his recollection that they must needs
      constrain his credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt it in the nature of a rescue one day when, as he chanced to join a
      group of gossips loitering around the fire of the forge, he heard the
      smith ask casually: &ldquo;Who is that thar baby visitin' at Peter Petrie 's
      over yander acrost Storm Mounting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gran'child, I reckon,&rdquo; suggested his big-boned, bare-armed, soot-grimed
      striker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Petrie hain't got nare gran'-child,&rdquo; said one of the loungers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tank, sober for once, held his breath to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behaves powerful like a gran'dad,&rdquo; observed the smith, holding a
      horseshoe with the tongs in the fire while the striker laid hold on the
      bellows and the sighing sound surged to and fro and the white blaze flared
      forth, showing the interested faces of the group in the dusky smithy, and
      among them the horse whose shoe was making, while another stood at the
      open door defined against the snow. &ldquo;Behaves like he ain't got a mite o'
      sense. I war goin' by thar one day las' week an' I stepped up on the porch
      ter pass the time o' day with Pete an' his wife, an' the door war open.
      And' what d'ye s'pose I seen! Old Peter Petrie a-goin' round the floor on
      all fours, an' a-settin' on his back war a baby&mdash;powerful peart
      youngster&mdash;jes' a-grinnin' an' a-whoopin' an' a-poundin' old Peter
      with a whip! An' Pete galloped, he did! Didn't seem beset with them
      rheumatics he used ter talk about&mdash;peartest leetle 'possum of a
      baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tank Dysart lost no time in his investigations and he had the courage of
      his convictions. He did not scruple to call Peter Petrie to his face a
      mail-robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye tuk a package deposited in the United States' mail and converted it to
      your own use,&rdquo; he vociferated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twar neither stamped nor addressed,&rdquo; old Petrie gruffly contended,
      albeit obviously disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dysart even sought to induce the postmaster to send a complaint of the
      rider to the postal authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got too much respec' fur my job,&rdquo; replied that worthy, jocosely eying
      Tank across the counter of the store. &ldquo;I ain't goin' ter let on ter the
      folks in Washington that we send babies about in the mail-bags hyar in the
      mountings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The social acquaintance of the little man had necessarily been rather
      limited, but one day a neighbor, attracted to the Petrie cabin by idle
      curiosity concerning the waif robbed from the mails, gazed upon him for
      one astonished instant and then proclaimed his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nare Gilhooley should ever cross Storm Mounting, 'cordin ter yer saying
      Petey, an' hyar ye hev been totin' Boss Gilhooley 's gran'son back an'
      forth across Old Stormy, an' all yer spare time ye spend on yer hands an'
      knees bar kin' like a dog jes' ter pleasure him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Petrie changed countenance suddenly. His square, bristly, grim jaw
      hardened and stiffened, so dear to him were all his stubborn convictions
      and grizzly, ancient feuds. But he bestirred himself to cause information
      to be conveyed to Bruce Gilhooley of his son's whereabouts for he readily
      suspected that the family had fled to Minervy Sue's in Georgia. Peter
      Petrie sustained in this act of conscience a grievous wrench, for it
      foreshadowed parting with the choice missive filched from the mail-bag,
      but he was not unmindful of the anguish and bereavement of the mother, and
      somehow the thought was peculiarly coercive at this season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want ter even up with King Herod, now, sure!&rdquo; he averred to
      himself one night as he sat late over the embers, reviewing his plans all
      made. He thought much in these lone hours as He heard the wind speed past,
      the trees crack under their weight of snow, and noted through the tiny
      window the glister of a great star of a supernal lustre, high above the
      pines, what a freight of joy the tidings of this child would bear to the
      bleeding hearts of his kindred. Albeit so humble, the parallel must needs
      arise suggesting the everlasting joy the existence of another Child had
      brought to the souls of all kindreds, all peoples. &ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo; he
      reiterated, as the red coals crumbled and the gray ash spread; &ldquo;Peace an'
      good-will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to epitomize all religion, all value, all hope' and
      somehow they so dwelt in his mind that the next day he was moved to add a
      personal message to old Boss Gilhooley in sending the more important
      information to Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let on ter Boss,&rdquo; he charged the envoy, &ldquo;ez&mdash;ez&mdash;that thar
      jedgmint an' execution issued war jes' formal&mdash;ye mought say&mdash;jes'
      ter hev all the papers reg'lar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By virtue of more attrition with the world the mail-rider was more
      sophisticated than his enemy, and sooth to say, more sophistical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss is writ-proof, the old fool, though he war minded ter cut me out'n
      my levy if he could! But waal, jes' tell him from me ez we-uns hev hed a
      heap o' pleasure in the baby's company in the Chris 'mus, an' we-uns
      expec' ter borry him some whenst they all gits home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the child's kindred the news was as if he had risen from the dead, and
      the gratitude of the Gilhooleys to Petrie knew no bounds. They had
      accounted the baby drowned when, missing him, they had retraced their way,
      finding naught but a bit of old blanket on which he had lain, close to the
      verge of the cruel river. Boss Gilhooley, softened and rendered tractable
      by exile and sorrow, upon his return lent himself to an affected warmth
      toward Peter Petrie which gradually assumed all the fervors of sincerity.
      The neighbors indeed were moved to say that the two friends and ancient
      enemies, when both on all fours and barking for the delight of the baby,
      were never so little like dogs in all their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a child shall lead them.
